      <p>Welcome to STEAMTEEN, where curiousity is encouraged and creativity blossoms! STEAMTEEN is a national conference dedicated to exposing teenagers to STEAM fields. We primarily cater to teenagers ages 13-18, but anyone is welcome to register and attend a conference! We accept everyone regardless of their background and strive to create a safe and welcoming community for all. While we do accept donations, our conferences are 100% free for <strong>ALL</strong> participants. The only things that are required in order to be fully immersed in the events are internet connection, access to <a href="https://zoom.us">Zoom</a>, and a passion for learning! This year, our 2022 virtual conference will be held on Zoom from July 6th to July 8th. Visit our sign up page or <a href="##">click here</a> to register!</p>
